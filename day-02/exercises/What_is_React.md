# What is React?

1.  What is React?
    
    ```
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Every React app is a single-page web application. 
    ```
2. What is a library?

    ```
    In the context of JavaScript, a library is a .js file that can be used to solve common problems that already have been solved by another programmers. This way, we do not lose time writing code that would be reinventing the wheel.
    ```
3. What is a single page application?

    ```
    When we say that React is a single page application library, it means that our project will only have one HTML file (index.html) and all our content will be processed and rendered in there.
    ```
4. What is a component?

    ```
    Copmonents are the building blocks of any React app and a typical React app will have many of these. 

    A component is a JavaScript class or function that optionally accepts inputs and returns a React element that describes how a section of the UI should be rendered.

5. What is the latest version of React?

    ```
    Currently, version 17.0.1.
    ```
6. What is DOM?

    ```
    Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents. It is a object oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
    
    Every properties, methods and events available for manipulating and creating web pages are organized into objects.
    ```

7. What is React Virtual DOM?

    ```
    DOM manipulation is the heart of the modern interactive web. It is a lot slower than most JavaScript operations.

    This slowness is made worse by the fact that most JavaScript frameworks update the DOM much more than they have to. So, inefficient updating has become a serious problem.

    A virtual DOM object is a lightweight copy of a DOM object.

    It has the same properties as a real DOM object. 

    React has a complex engineering to know which objects to change without beeing inefficient.
    ```

8. What does a web application or a website(composed of) have?

    ```
    Basically, it needs a web browser (client), a web application server and a database.
    ```
